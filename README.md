<h1>Aircraft Tracking System</h1>

<p>The specifcation required the creation of an Aircraft Flight Tracking Application that would support several specific 'Aircraft' including 'Passenger Plane' (which I would be responsible for), 'Helicopter', 'Cargo Plane', 'Private' and 'Military'.</p>

<p>Each aircraft would have shared instance variables and methods with aircraft as well as specific instance variables and methods for their own type.</p>

<p>This OOP solution required the use of inheritance, ENUMs as well as full JUnit testing.</p>

<p>A driver class AircraftSearch would also be required to facilited user searches - using parameterised methods.</p>
